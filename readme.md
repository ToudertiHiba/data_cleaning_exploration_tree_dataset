# Street Tree Dataset Cleaning and Exploration

This project focuses on the exploration and cleaning of the "2015_Street_Tree_Census_-_Tree_Data.csv" dataset, which contains information about street trees in a particular area. 

## Overview

The main objectives of this project include understanding the dataset's characteristics, addressing missing values, and performing necessary cleaning operations.
